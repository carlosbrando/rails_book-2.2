		<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Around July of 2004 David Heinemeier Hansson publicly released the Ruby on Rails framework. The framework had been extracted from a web application called he was working on called Basecamp. More than three years later, on the December 7th 2007, Ruby on Rails version 2.0 was released with numerous important changes.</p>

<p>Six months have passed since then, and during this time more than <strong>1400 developers</strong> from all around the world have contributed  <strong>1600 patches</strong> to the framework. Today, June 1st 2008, version 2.1 of the Ruby on Rails framework was released.</p>

<p>Major new features according to David Heinemeier Hansson:</p>

<ul>
<li>Timezones</li>
<li>Dirty tracking</li>
<li>Gem Dependencies</li>
<li>Named scope</li>
<li>UTC-based migrations</li>
<li>Better caching</li>
</ul>


<p>As always, to update or install the new version:</p>

<pre class="mac_classic">gem install rails
</pre>
