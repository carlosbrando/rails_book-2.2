This program may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions
of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2 of this
license or (at your option) any later version, with the following
extensions:

- A distribution may omit the files data/uninames.dat and
  ucs-doc.dvi

- The directory structure may be changed

- A distribution may split the package into smaller packages, as long
  as this fact is visible to the user and the user may easily install
  the complete UCS package (e.g. by installing all small packages).

- The data/uni-*.def files may be regenerated via makeunidef.pl
  from a valid set of config/*.def files without changing the former's
  names, whereby a valid set of config/*.ucf files consists of the
  original files and any local additions in separate files, whereby
  any characters defined in these should only be accessible via an
  option which starts with the five letters 'local'. (See the
  documentation files for a description of the technical terms and
  names in this paragraph).

- Files in the unsupported/ directory may be omitted.

- Scripts (i.e. executable files which are not TeX input), may be
  renamed, as long as the original name without suffix is part of the
  new name (e.g. discovermacro.pl -> latex-ucs-discovermacro) and as
  long this is stated in some documentation file shipped with the
  distribution. Occurrences of the scripts' names in the documentation
  may be changed to match the new name.

- Parts of files explicitly marked as "configuration data" may be
  changed by distributions, as long this is stated in a comment near
  the place of that modification and in some documentation file
  shipped with the distribution.

This program consists of all files found at
http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/ucs.

The latest version of this license (without the extensions mentioned
above) can be found in
    http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
version 1999/06/01 or later.
