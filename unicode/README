This package contains support for using UTF-8 as input encoding in
LaTeX documents.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

The simplest use of this package is to add
	\usepackage{ucs}
	\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
to your header. You may even omit the first line in many cases. Often
however you need to load additional packages etc., see
languages.ps.gz for language-specific examples.

The tables with LaTeX macros for the glyphs does not contain many
entries yet. If your particular script is not supported, and you add
the macros to the config files (see INSTALL and perldoc
makeunidef.pl), please mail me those config files, and together with
informations, if special packages or LaTeX versions are needed for
these macros. Please do only supply macros, which generate aesthetic
glyphs, no hacks. See also
