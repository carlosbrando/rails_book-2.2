To install this LaTeX UTF-8 support, simply put the files ucs.sty,
utf8x.def, ucsencs.def and data/* somewhere in your TeX-path. If you
want CJK characters, you need the c??enc.def files, too. For Klingon
you need lklenc.def and lklkli.fd.

You may have to run some command like mktexlsr, lest the files will
not be found by TeX. What to do, however, is distribution dependent.

Warning: If you install the files into some directory, where TeX does
not search recursively (usually the current directory and your
personal TeX directory are of that kind), you have to put the contents
of data directly into that directory.

If you don't install data/uninames.dat, you will save abount 300 KB,
but you won't get the full names of the characters in error messages.

If you have added glyphs macros in one of the files in config (see
perldoc makeunidef.pl for information on the config file format), you
have to recreate the files in data.

First you need UnicodeData.txt from

	http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt

(you may gzip it after downloading) and then you can recreate the files
using

	perl makeunidef.pl -t data --nocomments config/*.ucf config/*.ucf.gz

You may supply another target directory instead of data, e.g. some
directory in your TeX-path. makeunidef.pl will not delete or overwrite
any files it has not created itself. If you add "--exclude
cjkbg5,cjkgb,cjkjis,cjkhangul", no CJK characters will not be included,
saving more than 1 MB of disk space.
