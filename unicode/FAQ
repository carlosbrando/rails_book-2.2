Question: LaTeX complains about missing commands I have not used. Why?

Answer: The ucs package uses many macros from many packages. You have
to include these into your preamble. To find out which package
contains the missing macro, you can use e.g.
    perl discovermacro.pl \themissingmacro
or
    perl discovermacro.pl mydocument.log
or use the online version at
   http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/cgi/discovermacro.cgi
or have a look at the human readable file
   ltxmacrs.txt.



Question: The package complains about the missing file uni-global.def
(and other files), but they are in the TeX search path.

Answer: Perhaps you have put the ucs/data directory in a directory
where TeX does not search recursively (e.g. your private TeX directory
or the current directory). You can change this by putting the unicode
package into a recursively searched directory or by putting the files
in ucs/data directly into the searched directory at top level.



Question: When I try to activate options in \usepackage[...]{ucs},
LaTeX complains about an option clash.

Answer: ucs.sty probably already got loaded via
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}. Try loading ucs.sty first or set the
options with \SetUnicodeOption.



Question: Why is the package named ucs.sty, but the directory unicode?
(Or: Why are you mixing the names of two different standards)

Answer: I started with unicode.sty, but there was an name clash with
Sebastian Rahtz' jadetex/passivetex package. And I think, applying to
practical solutions like this one, it is OK to use Unicode and UCS as
synonyms. (UCS is an ISO standard, which has goals similar to those of
Unicode, both standards agreed to stay compatible.)



Question: I get an "TeX capacity exceeded" error. What can I do?

Answer: Try the option "savemem". This will reduce the memory
consumption of ucs.sty, especially if you use CJK glyphs, but will
also slow down operation significantly. Or increase TeX's capacity, if
this is feasible in your situation.



Question (Esperanto): LATIN SMALL LETTER H WITH CIRCUMFLEX is ugly. ^h
with babel package option esperanto is not. Why?

Answer: esperanto.ldf has its own macro for ^h, ucs uses the standard
\^h. Add
  \DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\^}{T1}{h}{h\llap{\^{}}}
  \DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\^}{OT1}{h}{h\llap{\^{}}}
to your preamble, then \^h and the corresponding unicode character will
yield the same as ^h.



Question: When a line of my document displayed in the TeX terminal
output or logfile, the non ascii characters are replaced by garbage. Why?

Answer: The first possibility is, that you don't read the output with
a unicode enabled terminal. The second is, that TeX replaces some
bytes by ^^XX sequences. I do not know how to tell TeX which
characters are to be escaped that way (tell me if you do). If no other
mean helps, you can use latexout.pl which converts such output to
UTF-8.
